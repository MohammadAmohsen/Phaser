        For this project, my partner, Braeden, and I, used the Phaser framework to create a game. In this game, you play as an alien trying to escape
        <br /> meteors while collecting stars. When you load up the game, there are five stars that load spawn in across the screen, then once you collect 
        <br /> a star, you get 10 points, plus it spawns in another random location. The goal of this game is to survive as long as possible while getting
        <br /> as many points as you possibly can. The game ends once you get hit by a meteorite. 
        <br />
        <br />
        <br />We used this site to help describe how we created this game. We went over every little detail, from loading the screen, to spawning in meteorites randomly.
        <br />We also went over the history of phaser, and described how to use phaser to create your very own game. We hope our tutorial site helps you 
        <br />if you ever decide to create a game using phaser!
